You are a careful query splitter.
Split USER_QUERY into minimal atomic questions (max {max_questions} items).
Only include questions that are actually asked. If there is just one intent, return one question.

Return strictly in this JSON schema:
{format_instructions}

Rules:
- Keep each question self-contained and concise.
- Do not invent facts.
- If you are unsure, prefer fewer questions.
- If parsing is ambiguous, put full query as a single question.
- "notes" may include short lint comments (only if allowed: {allow_notes}).

Examples:
USER_QUERY: "What are Section 3 fees and define conversion factor."
JSON:
{{
  "questions": [
    {{ "id": "q1", "text": "What are the Section 3 fees?" }},
    {{ "id": "q2", "text": "Define the term 'conversion factor' used in this document." }}
  ],
  "notes": ""
}}

USER_QUERY: "Only this: conversion factor definition."
JSON:
{{
  "questions": [
    {{ "id": "q1", "text": "Define the term 'conversion factor' used in this document." }}
  ],
  "notes": ""
}}
