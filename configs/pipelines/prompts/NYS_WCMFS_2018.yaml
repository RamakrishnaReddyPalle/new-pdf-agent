prompts:
  qa:
    generic: Ask grounded questions and answer strictly from the provided text; include
      units and definitions if present.
    fee_schedule: Generate Q&A about conversion factors, RVUs, section-specific rules,
      and modifiers. For answers, compute simple fees if explicitly possible from
      text.
    math_heavy: Generate Q&A that walks step-by-step through formulas in the text
      (keep equations intact, no hallucination).
    tables: 'Generate Q&A that read table rows: codeâ†’description, value lookups, column
      meanings; cite column headers.'
  summary:
    generic: Summarize clearly with key points; keep any formulas verbatim.
    fee_schedule: Summarize ground rules, conversion factor usage per section, and
      exceptions.
    math_heavy: Summarize methods for computing fees; preserve LaTeX/inline math if
      present.
    tables: Summarize what the table contains (columns, usage) without recreating
      the whole table.
