This schedule provides comprehensive billing guides, which will allow health \ncare providers to appropriately describe their services and minimize disputes over \nreimbursement. Also, this schedule includes many new procedures and coding \nchanges that have taken place since the previously published fee schedule.\nThis fee schedule could not have been produced without the assistance of many \nindividuals. The spirit of cooperation between the provider and payer communities is \nvery much appreciated. The excellence of this schedule is due, in large part, to the \ncommitment of many people in the workers’ compensation community. We are \ngrateful for their efforts.\nThis fee schedule is effective for medical services rendered on or after April 1, 2019, \nregardless of the date of accident. The fees established herein are payable to health \ncare providers authorized or permitted to render care under the Workers’ \nCompensation Law, Volunteer Firefighters’ Benefit Law, and Volunteer Ambulance \nWorkers’ Benefit Law.\nNew York State Workers’ Compensation Board\n\n# Page 5\nContents\nThe Official New York State Workers’ Compensation \nMedical Fee Schedule\n1\nIntroduction and General Guidelines . . . . . . . . .1\nFormat . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nHow To Interpret Fee Schedule Data . . . . . . . . . . 2\nSpecialty Classifications . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\nPostal ZIP Codes by Region . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nConversion Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\nCalculating Fees Using Relative Values \nand Conversion Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\nNew CPT Codes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\nChanged Codes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\nDeleted CPT Codes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\nGeneral Ground Rules . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n2 \nEvaluation and Managment (E/M) . . . . . . . . . .21\nEvaluation and Management Ground Rules . . . 21\n3 \nAnesthesia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .45\nAnesthesia Ground Rules . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45\n4 \nSurgery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .57\nSurgery Ground Rules . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 57\n5 \nRadiology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .253\nRadiology Ground Rules . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 253\n6 \nPathology and Laboratory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .279\nPathology and Laboratory Ground Rules . . . . 279\n7 \nMedicine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .329\nMedicine Ground Rules . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 329\n8 \nPhysical Medicine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .371\nPhysical Medicine Ground Rules . . . . . . . . . . 371\n9 \nCategory III Codes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .381\nCategory III Ground Rules . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 381\nProvider Fee Schedules\nBehavioral Health Fee Schedule\nChiropractic Fee Schedule\nPodiatry Fee Schedule\n---\n\nReturn YAML with keys: detection, prompts.\n- detection: {\"default\":\"generic\",\"profiles\":{\"fee_schedule\":{\"include_any\":[...]},\"math_heavy\":{\"include_any\":[...]},\"tables\":{\"include_any\":[...]}}}\n- prompts.qa: provide 'generic', 'fee_schedule', 'math_heavy', 'tables' strings.\n- prompts.summary: same keys as qa.\nAim for question styles covering abbreviations, conversion factors, code→description lookups, and step-by-step fee calculations (keep arithmetic grounded by text)."
